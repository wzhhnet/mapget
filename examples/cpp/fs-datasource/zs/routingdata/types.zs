## Plural Junction

Maneuvers for a plural junction can require a different explanation than the
one that can be derived from the geometry. The `PLURAL_JUNCTION` attribute indicates
how a driver will perceive such a junction.

Plural junctions are categorized by a type that is used to select appropriate
guidance instructions, for example, to suppress certain guidance instructions.

The following figures show examples of different plural junction types.

## Special Transition Code

A special transition code is assigned to a transition where the most suitable
driving advice cannot be easily derived from the geometry of the roads that
are connected to the intersection, for example, in the following cases:

- Two roads leaving an intersection that are so close to each other that both
  seem to go straight ahead for the driver.
- One road is dividing into two or more streets, also known as a bifurcation.
- The main road bends slightly and a side road of minor importance leaves the
  intersection straight ahead. The driver would consider the main road to go
  straight ahead. Therefore, no guidance instruction for the main road is required,
  but the driver would expect a turn instruction for the side road.

The following figure shows a main road with a bend and a side road that goes
straight ahead. The transition for staying on the main road has assigned the
special transition code `ALONG_MAIN_ROAD`, while the transition from main road
to side road gets assigned the value `BEAR_STRAIGHT`.

## Eco Routing

Eco routing is an option for route calculation that minimizes fuel consumption
and emissions.

The following infrastructural factors influence the calculation of eco routes
and have to be taken into account for eco routing with NDS.Live:

- Consumption Speed Curve (CSC)
- Speed variation
- Slope

NDS.Live defines dedicated attributes that provide precalculated eco routing
data.

__Note:__
Details about calculating the attribute values for eco routing are provided
in a best practice.

rule_group EcoRoutingRules
{
  /*!
  No Vehicle-Specific Eco Routing Attributes:

  Eco routing attributes shall be based on the road infrastructure only.
  The attributes shall not define vehicle-specific values.
  !*/

  rule "routingdata-f26tj2-I";
};

/*!

### Consumption Speed Curve (CSC)

The CSC describes the speed-dependent fuel or energy consumption for a vehicle
driving at a constant height and at a distinct average speed. The CSC takes
fluctuations of normal traffic speed into consideration. Specific consumption
effects, however, which could also be derived from a map, are modeled
separately by means of the factors for speed variation and slope.

NDS.Live provides the attribute `CONSUMPTION_SPEED_DEPENDENCY` to store the
CSC. The attribute stores an array of consumption speed values.
Each consumption speed value is a tuple of an average speed value and the
percentage of the road to which the average speed applies.
The percentage factor acts as a weighting factor for the CSC calculation.

On level 13, each road has a dedicated average speed value assigned.
The application can use this value for table lookup and to calculate the
consumption value at runtime. For aggregated roads on upper routing levels,
the CSC is represented as a maximum of 256 value pairs of average speed values
and their corresponding percentage factors.

It is possible to apply the vehicle-specific CSC both on level 13 and on
aggregated (upper) levels. On the most detailed level where one road has a
dedicated average speed, this value may be directly used at runtime for
table lookup and be transformed into a consumption value.

On upper levels, having aggregated roads with an 'inside' spread of
different average speeds, these may be represented as a maximum of n = 256
value pairs of average speed values and their corresponding weight factors
wn, represented as a road percentage value.

    * the road, which can be used for consumption calculation.
    */
  SpeedKmh averageSpeed : averageSpeed > SPEED_UNDEFINED;
};

/*!

### Slope

Road slope above a specific threshold causes excessive consumption due to a
higher energy effort during uphill driving and an energy waste due to braking
when driving downhill.

NDS.Live provides the attributes `CONSUMPTION_UP_EXCESS_SLOPE`,
`CONSUMPTION_DOWN_EXCESS_SLOPE`, and `CONSUMPTION_AVERAGE_SLOPE` to store slope values.
The threshold used to calculate the excess slope is stored in the routing
metadata in `excessSlopeThreshold`.

!*/

/**
  * Defines the excess slope of a road or lane, that is, the slope that is exceeding a
  * defined threshold. Used for eco routing. Slope has no unit.
  * The slope value is scaled to 255 values with a resolution 0.1 % per bit,
  * a value of 0-25 equals 5 % excess slope.
  */
subtype uint8 ExcessSlope;

/*!

### Speed Variation

Speed variation affects fuel consumption due to changes in kinetic energy,
especially caused by braking and accelerating at curves, transitions, and intersections.

NDS.Live provides the attribute `CONSUMPTION_SPEED_VARIATION` to
store the consumption factor for speed variation.

**Road example**

If the original speed variation along a 200 m road is from 50 km/h (~13.889 m/s) to
80 km/h (~22.222 m/s), then the square difference is:

1. 22.222^2 - 13.889^2 = 493.817 - 192.904 = 300.913 [m^2/s^2]
1. scaled by 128: 300.913 * 128 = 38516.864
1. normalized to length of road (200 m): 38516.864/200 = 192.584

The resulting value is rounded to 193 and stored. If the calculated
value is higher than 255, then the value 255 is stored.

The original value is inversely recovered by multiplying the stored value
by road length in m then divided by a factor of 128 (easily done by shifts).

Because the transition factors at intersections cannot be normalized to the road
length, they are calculated by dividing by 4 (easily done by shifts).

**Transition example**

If an acceleration maneuver is from 50 km/h (~14 m/s) to
80 km/h (~22 m/s), then the square difference is:

1. (22^2 â€“ 14^2) = (494 - 193) = 301 [m^2/s^2]
1. divided by 4: 301 / 4 = 75

The value 75 is stored.

/**
  * Defines normalized energy difference measures for kinetic energy used for
  * consumption penalties at curves, transitions, and intersections by measuring
  * squared speed differences. Used for eco routing and range calculation.
  *
  * The value range is from 0 to 255 [m/s^2] with a scale factor of 128.

## Speed Profiles

Speed profiles describe time-specific driving speeds on a road range. A speed
profile is either valid for one day or for a set of days, for
example, a speed profile that covers all days of a holiday season.

Each day of the speed profile is divided into equal time intervals. The length
of an interval can be freely chosen between a few minutes and several hours and
is defined by the number of speed values in the `SpeedProfile.values` array.
Days always start at midnight. To calculate the length of a time interval, an
application divides the complete time range covered by the speed profile by the
number of speed values.

Example: A speed profile for a single day covers a time range of 1440 minutes
and contains 288 speed values, which means that each time interval has a length
of 5 minutes.

For each time interval and travel direction of a road range, the speed profile
stores a speed value that represents the average speed of the free-flow traffic
in the middle of the given interval. The first value in the
`SpeedProfile.values` array corresponds to the first time interval.

If a speed profile applies to a complete day, then the first value in the array
is valid for entry times from 0:00:00 and represents the average speed
value of that time interval. If a vehicle enters a road at a given time, then
the application can use the speed profile value of the time interval containing
this time.
